PyGrbl - a python interface for grbl that will hopefully one day provide EMC2-like functionality. Written using PyQt, under OS X. Also needs PyQGLViewer.

At the moment, there are just test and stub programs:
- pygrbl is the main program
- gc_parser parses the g-code files and puts the parsed result in an OpenGL window
- grblserial provides the interface to my version of grbl, see elsewhere on github.

At present, grblserial is a command line sequencer for g-code that is written 'just right' - in other words, it isn't very robust about g-codes that grbl can't understand.

The code is very rough and ready, but take a look, and get in touch if you're interested...
