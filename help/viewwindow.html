	  <p>The view window shows the g-code file in 3D form. </p>

	<h1>Manipulating the view menu</h1>
	Simple manipulation is
	available using the mouse:
	<ul>
	<li>Left button: rotate in X and Y directions by clicking and dragging. 
	Rotation around the z-axis is not available. 
	<li>Right button: click and drag to move the centre of the view.
	<li>Scroll button: zoom in and out.
	</ul>

	<p>A number of preset views can be selected using the icons below the
	3D viewer area. There are two top views, with the long axis aligned
	horizontally or vertically. There are also views from the left side,
	and the front, and an isometric view of the model.
	</p>
	<p>
	To reset the view, use the rightmost icon that looks like a snow
    flake. It will set the view to its default position and zoom, usually
    centering it while filling the view window.
	</p>

	<h2>Mouse coordinate display</h2>
	<p>In the bottom right hand corner, the mouse coordinates are
	displayed. This can be useful for checking dimensions. Coordinates
	are only strictly valid in the default top view, where they match
	the x and y coordinates of the model. In other views, they are
	probably wrong.

	<h2>Coordinates and wait display</h2>
	<p>Overlayed on the 3D viewer are the 3D coordinates currently being
    reported by the milling machine, via Grbl. If the machine is in a
	dwell, the time left in the dwell in seconds is also displayed.
	</p>
	<p>The position of the milling cutter is also indicated by a
	stylized triangular cutter, which moves over the g-code
	visualization, keeping track of current position. If the cursor
	moves away from lines, it is likely to be cutting in the wrong
	place.
	</p>
