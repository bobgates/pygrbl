    If g-code files are loaded, using File-Open, they will appear in
    the program window. Execution can then be controlled using the play-stop
    <img alt="Play control" src="images/play.png" width=20 height=20 />
    <img alt="Pause control" src="images/pause.png" width=20 height=20/> 
    and single step <img alt="Single step control"
    src="images/singlestep.png" width=20 height=20 /> controls.
    
    <p>
    Pygrbl sends commands to fill grbls queue, but shows exactly which
    line of g-code is currently being worked on with a coloured highlight.
    
    <p>
    Pressing the stop button on the toolbar <img alt="Single step control"
    src="images/stop.png" width=20 height=20 /> at any time will send
    an emergency stop to grbl, stopping milling immediately. The stop 
    button is grey if grbl is not running, or red if it is currently
    executing a command, either in a program or manually.
