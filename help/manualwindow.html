    The manual window consists of a command line and a record window
    showing all commands entered in the session.

    <p>
    Any g-code command can be entered on the command line. If the
    enter key is pressed while the cursor is visible on the command
    line, it will have the same effect as clicking the 'Go' button,
    and will add the g-code command to the queue to be sent to grbl.
    If grbl is not currently processing a g-code command, it will
    immediately start with the new command.

    <p>
    Also available while typing in the command line are up and down
    cursors that can be used to select a previously typed command.
    The previously typed line can then be edited, if necessary, and
    added to the queue by pressing enter or clicking the 'Go' button.
