    <p>
    On the jog tab, there are 12 buttons: which are up and
    down for each of 3 axes, at each of two step sizes. Three
    step sizes are available and are configurable on the 
    <a href="viewwindow.html">preferences</a> page. 
    The buttons with a single arrowhead select the middle step 
    size. The double arrowhead selects the large step size.
    The small step size is only available via the keyboard.
    
    <p> Each of the buttons has a shortcut key on the cursor pad
    and another on the numeric keypad. The x-axis buttons are
    mapped to left and right, and to 4 and 6 on the numeric keypad.
    The y-axis buttons are mapped to up and down, and to 8 and 2
    on the numeric keypad. The z-axis buttons are mapped to page-up
    and page-down and to plus and minus on the numeric keypad.

    <p>Each of the keys on the keyboard moves the corresponding
    axis by the middle step size when used on its own. If shift
    is pressed simultaneously, the large step size is used. To
    obtain the small size step, the buttons are pressed while
    pressing the apple or command key.

    <p>It is often not clear whether the jog controls are active.
    In active mode, the controls appear in a frame, as in the
    figure above, and the word 'Active' appears in the bottom
    right corner.
